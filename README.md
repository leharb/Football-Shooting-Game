As a part of the course 'COMP102x Introduction to Computing with Java' offered by the Hong Kong 
University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-
v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+2T2015/info) on edx.org, I wrote the code for a project wherein I was supposed to write 3 methods of a Java class provided to me during the course.
The project aimed at developing a game based on Java in which the user hits a football displayed on 
the screen through the mouse with the aim of hitting one of the many goalposts on the screen. To 
make the game interesting, I had to code in such a way so as to make the goalposts movable across 
the screen. The 3 methods which I was supposed to write were:

Method to generate a football image: This was the easiest of the 3 methods. I just had to code 
few lines that displayed an image of the football on the screen. The .png format of the ball was given 
in the project module (png stands for Portable Network Graphics. It is a type of image format)

Method to update the goalpost positions: This was a method that swapped a movable goalpost 
with a goalpost which yet hadnâ€™t been hit. This formed the core logic of movable goalposts.

Method to update high score records: This was a method that updated the high scores of the 
game with name, level and score of the player.

The java code works only with the classes provided during the course and not independently.
